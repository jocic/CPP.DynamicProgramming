## Problems

*   [Fibonacci Sequence](problems/001-fib/main.cpp) - Write a function `fib(n)` that takes in a number as an argument. The function should return the n-th number of the Fibonacci sequence.

*   [Grid Traveler](problems/002-gridTraveler/main.cpp) - Say that you are a traveler on a 2D grid. You begin in the top-left corner and your goal is to travel to the bottom-right corner. You may only move down or right. In how many ways can you travel to the goal on a grid with dimensions m * n?

*   [Can Sum](problems/003-canSum/main.cpp) - Write a function `canSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes in a targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments. The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not it is possible to generate the `targetSum` using numbers from the array. You may use an element of the array as many times as needed, and you may assume that all input numbers are non-negative.
